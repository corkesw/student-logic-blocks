SOLUTIONS
1: ok solution, good use of for loops but the student could have challenged themselves a bit more with higher order functions. Might be the equivalent of using a rock to hit a nail, instead of a hammer.

2: good solution, the student coded for a case where dna is an empty string. Good use of switch and forEach.

3: great solution, nice use of lookup object although we could have been able to avoid creating so many arrays inside of it. Checks for cases in which some of the letters are not representing any base.

4: great solution, good understanding of how a lookup object works. The student challenged himself to create a one liner but sacrificed readability because of it.

TESTS
1: dna is a string and not an array, poor understanding of the problem and overall insufficient testing.

2: sufficient testing if we assume no input errors.

3: sufficient testing with the addition of filtering wrong inputs.
